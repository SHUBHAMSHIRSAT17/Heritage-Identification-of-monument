# Heritage-Identification-of-Monuments-
java, andriod app
Identifying the heritage and identity of monuments using technologies such as Java, machine learning (ML), artificial neural networks (ANN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and deep learning involves using image recognition and classification techniques.

1. Java: Java can be used for implementing the backend and handling the processing of the image data.
2. Machine Learning (ML): ML algorithms can be trained on image datasets to recognize patterns and features that distinguish different monuments.
3. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): ANN can be used to create a model that learns to identify monuments based on the features extracted from images.
4. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): CNN is particularly effective for image recognition tasks, as it can automatically learn and extract relevant features from images.
5. Deep Learning: Deep learning techniques, such as deep neural networks, can be utilized to build a more sophisticated model for monument identification.
